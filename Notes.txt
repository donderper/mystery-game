roles have distinct victory conditions

some roles are hidden - secondary roles?

story

roles have distinct actions, distinct information

rather than having specific roles, taking advantage of the real time, free form aspect of the platform,
by perhaps having varying tasks and available information / interaction at a given time for different player.
Still keeping clear cut goals but focusing on developing a system of conflicating / overlapping goals
for generating interesting interactions. Maybe assign role names to the goals themselves.

actions:
transfer info - password (detect vs transfer)
misinformation - inject wrong password

Locations - known in server
list of possible passwords (fake passwords - "jester" injection)
passphrases - identify allies

two players can pass info - restricted info
public info - anonymous - delayed message
location based effects 

backstory - affectation
music
conversation starters
